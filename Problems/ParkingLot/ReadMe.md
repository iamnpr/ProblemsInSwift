## PARKING LOT
Parking Lot problem takes a variety of forms. The objective is to find a parking space for a vehicle. 

#### Simple Problem
In a simpler world, parking spot is the a list of designated area where a vehicle can be parked. There are x number of spaces. If vehicle is parked in a space then the space becomes unavailable. 

#### Complicate the space
The problem can be made complex by adding space complexities. The below are the few space complexities.

###### Space type
There are different types of designated spaces. 

 1. Motorcycle Space.
 2. Compact Space.
 3. Large Space.


So, a motorcycle can be parked in any of the three places, compact vehicles can be parked in compact or large space. And large vehicles can be parked only in Large space.
 

###### Level
 
 The level complexity is parking level complexity. Let say the parking level is multilevel parking facility. The same layout is replicated above or below and there are multilevels to the parking facility. 
 
 The problem objective may be to find the `nearest available spot`.
 
 
#### Complicate the Vehicle
 
 The complication of vehicle can be done multiple ways.
 
 ###### Vehicle occupying multilane
 
 There can be a Bus
