# 🏫 Parking Lot Problem
Parking Lot problem takes a variety of forms. The objective is to find a parking space for a vehicle or alternatively calculate the cost of parking. 

#### Simple Problem
In a simpler world, parking spot is the a list of designated area where a vehicle can be parked. There are x number of spaces. If vehicle is parked in a space then the space becomes unavailable. 

#### Complicate the space
The problem can be made complex by adding space complexities. The below are the few space complexities.

###### Space type
There are different types of designated spaces. 

 1. Motorcycle Space 🏍.
 2. Compact Space 🚘.
 3. Large Space 🚍.


So, a motorcycle can be parked in any of the three places, compact vehicles can be parked in compact or large space. And large vehicles can be parked only in Large space.

###### Level
 
 The level complexity is parking level complexity. Let say the parking level is multilevel parking facility. The same layout is replicated above or below and there are multilevels to the parking facility. 
 
 The problem objective may be to find the `nearest available spot`.
 
 
#### Complicate the Vehicle 🚘
 
 The complication of vehicle can be done multiple ways.
 
###### Vehicle 🚙 occupying multilane
 
 There can be a Bus 🚌, RV 🚐, small truck 🚜, large truck 🚛, which can take multiple spots. The number of spots that needs differs from one vehicle to another. Now this is not spot size (space) problem howere finding a 5 consucutive vacant spot problem.
 
###### Vehicle 🚙 parking rules

Parking rules may be such that a motorcycle can be only parked in motorcycle space or other set of rules that might affect how the vehicle may be parke.

#### Complicate by Time/Cost:

Alternatively instead of finding the spot the complication can be achieve by time (reserve a parking spot) or Cost (how much a spot would cost).
